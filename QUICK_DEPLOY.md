# 🚀 Quick Deploy Fix for CORS Issues

## What We've Fixed
✅ **Added Vercel API proxy** (`/api/anthropic.js`) to bypass CORS  
✅ **Updated AI service** to use proxy instead of direct Anthropic calls  
✅ **Enhanced template fallbacks** for when AI fails  
✅ **All files committed** and ready to deploy  

## 🎯 Deploy Now (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
# In your terminal, from the project directory:
git push origin main
```
*If this fails, you may need to authenticate with GitHub first*

### Step 2: Vercel Auto-Deploy
- Vercel should automatically detect the push and start deploying
- Check your Vercel dashboard at https://vercel.com/dashboard
- The new deployment will include the `/api/anthropic` proxy

### Step 3: Test the Fix
After deployment completes:

1. **Go to your deployed URL**: `https://neuronforge-sable.vercel.app`
2. **Create a new project**: Try "build a simple todo app"
3. **Check console**: Should see `🔗 Using AI proxy: /api/anthropic`
4. **Verify file generation**: Should now work without CORS errors

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ **Success Indicators:**
- Console shows: `🔗 Using AI proxy: /api/anthropic`
- No more CORS errors from `api.anthropic.com`
- Files appear in sandbox: "X files received from agents"
- Static preview shows generated content

### ❌ **If Still Failing:**
- Template fallbacks will still generate files
- Check console for specific errors
- Verify API key is properly set in settings

## 🛠️ Backup Plan: Manual Deploy

If git push fails, you can:

1. **Download project as ZIP** from this environment
2. **Drag & drop to Netlify**: https://app.netlify.com/drop
3. **Or use Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npx vercel --prod
   ```

## 🎯 Expected Result

After this deploy:
- **AI generation will work** via proxy
- **File transfers will succeed** 
- **No more CORS blocks**
- **Templates as fallback** if AI fails
- **Full functionality restored**

The proxy API handles the Anthropic calls server-side, completely bypassing browser CORS restrictions!

## 📋 Files Changed
- ✅ `api/anthropic.js` - New Vercel serverless function
- ✅ `src/services/aiService.ts` - Updated to use proxy
- ✅ Build assets updated with changes
